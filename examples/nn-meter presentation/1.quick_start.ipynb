    "# Quick Start of nn-Meter\n",
    "nn-Meter is a novel and efficient toolkit to accurately predict the inference latency of DNN models on diverse edge devices. nn-Meter has achieved the **Mobisys 21 Best Paper Award**, here is the paper link: [nn-Meter: towards accurate latency prediction of deep-learning model inference on diverse edge devices](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458864.3467882). nn-Meter has been released as open source in [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/nn-Meter) and released as python package. In this notebook, we will try to leap the first step to use nn-Meter predictor, benchmark dataset and nn-Meter building tools. Let's start our journey!\n",

    "nn-Meter supports and is tested on Ubuntu >= 16.04, macOS >= 10.14.1, and Windows 10/11. Simply run the following `pip install` in an environment that has `python 64-bit >= 3.6`.\n",
